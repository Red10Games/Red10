              <p class="h4">The game relies on technology called <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.services.analytics.html"><span class="link">Unity Analytics</span></a> to monitor and collect anonymous data about player activities within the game. As an example, the collected data includes, but is not limited to, the following game-related indicators: best tile and score the player has got at the end of the game, achievements the player has completed. All collected data is strictly anonymous and is used solely for providing support for the internal operations and to improve the game.</p>

              <h3><span class="key-word">SOCIAL GAMING DATA (mobile versions)</span></h3>
              <p class="h4">As soon as you have installed the game to your device, you generally can use it without access to the Internet. Internet access is necessary if you use the social gaming network which is integrated into the app (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/game-center/"><span class="link">Apple Game Center</span></a> for iOS or <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services"><span class="link">Google Play Game Services</span></a> for Android). If you use the aforementioned social gaming networks the game will – after your corresponding separate logon – transfer the information which is necessary to use this service to the respective social gaming network. This information includes game results (e.g. high scores and achievements), which will be connected to your social gaming network account and saved permanently. The details of the further processing of your personal data are the responsibility of the social gaming network provider and are subject to their respective terms of use.</p>
              <p class="h4">Please read <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/game-center/"><span class="link">Game Center & Privacy</span></a> for details about data collected by Apple Game Center.</p>
